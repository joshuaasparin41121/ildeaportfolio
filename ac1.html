<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2 style >Chapter 1</h2>
<p style=" font-size: 25px;"> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly had been
<br> staring out of her window for about an hour now. 
<br> On her desk, lying between the copies of
 <i> <br>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the
<br> other scientific journals her work had appeared 
<br> in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. 
<br> It had been Molly's favourite book since college,
<br> and the longer she spent in these four walls 
<br> the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

<p style=" font-size: 25px;"> <br>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
<br> sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
<br> proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who
 <br>havenothing better to do. Although many considered
<br> her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llamato
<br> be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.</p>
